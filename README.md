# International Road Trip Planner

## Introduction
The International Road Trip Planner is a Java-based application utilizing
an object-oriented approach to calculate the shortest distance for traveling
between two countries, specifically from capital city to capital city. This
project leverages real-world data from [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/land-boundaries/)
to gather information on borders, distances between capitals, state names/aliases,
and uses this information to create an undirected graph. The application implements
Dijkstra's algorithm to find the most efficient travel path.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a command line tool

### Installation and Running the Program
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ccrawford4/International-Road-Trip-Planner.git
```
2. Open the project in your IDE or navigate to the project directory in your command line tool.
3. To compile the program, run:
```bash
$ javac Source/Classes/IRoadTrip
```
4. To run the program use:
```bash
$ java Source/Classes/IRoadTrip
```

## Usage
The application can be used to plan road trips between countries by calculating the shortest path from one capital city to another.
